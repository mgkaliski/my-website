    <div><h2>About me:</h2>
    </div>
    <p><h3>
     My name is Mikayla Kaliski, I am going to be a senior at Aragon High School. For the last 2 years
     I have written news articles for my school’s newspaper called the Aragon Outlook. This upcoming year
     I will take over as Photo Editor and manage the photo staff while at the same time collaborating
     with the other editors to create the best content that we can! I first began to develop my photography
     skills in 2017 when I took a summer course for photography at the Academy of Art University.
     Additionally, I took part in my school’s yearbook for the last 2 years where I took pictures
     of sports and student life. Some of my hobbies include running, interior design, and coding.

      I really enjoy traveling and getting to work with animals. I recently just started
      volunteering at the Peninsula Humane Society in the kitten nursery. Here, I feed
      the kittens, interact with them, and clean their kennels.
